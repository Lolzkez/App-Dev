# App-Dev
 Bookstore Application designed in React Native. 
 Will have similar functionality to a Kindle or iOS Books, where users can read and purchase books, and authors can publish books on the platform as well.
 Will eventually use the AWS mobile backend, and the Amazon Books API. 
 The aim of this is to demonstrate and improve my React Native skills, as well as my understanding of APIs and backend by using something not of my own creation.
