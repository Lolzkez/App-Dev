# App-Dev
 Bookstore Application designed in React Native. 
 Will have similar functionality to a Kindle or iOS Books, where users can read and purchase books, and authors can publish books on the platform as well.
 Will eventually use the AWS mobile backend, and the Amazon Books API. 
 The aim of this is to demonstrate and improve my React Native skills, as well as my understanding of APIs and backend by using something not of my own creation. 

 
This is an expo app, so you need to download Expo Go if you want to test it on your mobile devices (iOS or Android).
To run this app, you need to download Node.js. 
Then, clone this repo, then cd App.

Once you are there, open up a console and type 
npx expo start
Then scan the QR code and the Expo Go app will open, and then you will be testing this app.
